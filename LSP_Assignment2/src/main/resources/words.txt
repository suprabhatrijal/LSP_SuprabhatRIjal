A word is any group of contiguous letters from the file. In other words, spaces, punctuation, and other non-letter characters separate words, and are not words themselves. This rule also means that numbers written as strings of digits (e.g., “100”) are not counted as words, and contractions are counted as two words separated by an apostrophe.  For simplicity, you can assume your files contain only words, spaces, digits and newlines.
